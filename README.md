# ☀️ Heliox — Real-Time Space Weather Intelligence

> Track the Sun. Protect the Grid.

Heliox is a cinematic, real-time space weather monitoring platform that translates live solar activity data into infrastructure risk intelligence for power grids, aviation, GPS/GNSS systems, HF radio, and satellite operations. Built with React + Vite, it streams live data directly from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center with zero API keys required.

## 🗺️ Pages & Routes

| Route | Page | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | Home | Cinematic hero, Kp gauge, storm scale cards, live stats |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard | 4 live charts + KPI row |
| `/alerts` | Alerts | Filterable NOAA alerts feed |
| `/impacts` | Impacts | Sector-by-sector risk cards |
| `/forecast` | Forecast | 3-day Kp bar chart |
| `/learn` | Learn | Educational accordion for Kp, CMEs, and NOAA scales |
| `/about` | About | Mission, data credits, and NOAA SWPC links |

## 🧮 Risk Calculation Logic

Risk levels are derived from live Kp and Bz values in `src/utils/riskCalculator.js`.

| Kp Range | Risk Level | Color |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 3 | Low | #3ddc84 |
| 4 | Moderate | #ffd166 |
| 5 – 6 | High | #ff9f40 |
| 7 | Severe | #ff4d4d |
| 8 – 9 | Extreme | #cc0000 |

GPS/GNSS risk is elevated to Severe when Bz < −10 nT and Kp ≥ 4, regardless of the base Kp risk level.

HF Radio risk is derived from live X-ray flux class independently of Kp.

## 🎨 Design System

Heliox uses a cinematic space-weather aesthetic:

- **Background**: Deep black surfaces with subtle atmospheric contrast
- **Typography**: Display-forward headings with a clean body type system
- **Surfaces**: Glass-like cards and layered panels for depth
- **Colors**: Neutral dark surfaces with data-driven green, yellow, orange, and red accents
- **Animations**: Motion-driven entrances and soft transitions for the hero and content blocks
- **Skeletons**: Shimmer loaders for all async data surfaces

---

## 🔄 Data Refresh Architecture

```text
useSpaceWeather.js
├── Promise.all([...fetch calls]) on mount
├── setInterval(fetchAll, 60_000)  ← refetch every 60s
├── setInterval(countdown, 1_000)  ← decrement secondsUntilRefresh
└── Exposes: kpData, alertsData, xrayData, magData,
    plasmaData, scalesData, forecastData,
    loading, error, secondsUntilRefresh
```

All data flows down from `src/router/AppRouter.jsx` into each page component.

## 📚 Learn: What Heliox Monitors

Space weather refers to environmental conditions in space driven by solar activity, including:

- **Solar Flares** — sudden X-ray and UV bursts that can cause HF radio blackouts on the dayside
- **CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections)** — magnetized plasma clouds that drive geomagnetic storms 1 to 3 days after eruption
- **Geomagnetic Storms** — measured by the Kp index and rated G1 to G5 by NOAA
- **Solar Energetic Particles** — high-energy particles that affect polar aviation and satellite electronics
- **Solar Wind** — continuous plasma stream; southward Bz can intensify storm conditions

Heliox turns this science into plain-language risk levels for critical infrastructure sectors.
